# DistributionIndex

This is a project which works off of Dan Ricard's code to provide a distirbution index, as in Swain and Morin 1996. Initially done for EGB cod, but now has been modified to be more flexible and applicable to maritime pollock as well. Data file pulls the data and has species-specific restrictions. The biomass index script should be ubiquitous and apply to whatever species file is generated by the data pull.

This project implies that you understand R cod, and code should not be used without you understanding what it does. For example, species-specific knowledge of areas, strata and management areas is required to avoid nonsensical results. There have been no vessel conversion factors applied.

The run consists of two coding files: a species pull file and a processing file. The species pull files are specific to their respective data sources (i.e. NMFS or DFO). Pick the right one for what you want.
