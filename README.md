# DistributionIndex

This is a project which works off of Dan Ricard's code to provide a distirbution index. Initially done for EGB cod, but now has been modified to be more flexible and applicable to various species. Data file pulls the data and has species-specific restrictions. The biomass index script should be ubiquitous and apply to whatever species file is generated by the data pull.

This project implies that you understand R and should not be used without understanding what it does. For example, species-specific knowledge of areas, strata and management areas is required to avoid nonsensical results.
